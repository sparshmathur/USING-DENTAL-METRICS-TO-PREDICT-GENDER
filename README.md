# USING-DENTAL-METRICS-TO-PREDICT-GENDER
The aim of this project is to analyze dental data to predict an individual's gender based on specific dental features. This endeavor integrates the fields of dentistry, data science, and machine learning to explore the correlations between dental characteristics and gender, ultimately developing a predictive model.
Introduction and Background
Dental anthropology has long studied the relationship between dental features and various demographic factors, including gender. Previous research indicates that certain dental characteristics, such as tooth size, shape, and wear patterns, exhibit sexually dimorphic traits. Leveraging these insights, this project seeks to apply modern data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict gender from dental features with high accuracy.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
The initial phase of the project involves the collection of a comprehensive dataset containing dental records. These records include measurements of teeth dimensions, morphology, dental arch form, and other relevant features. The dataset also contains the gender of the individuals, serving as the target variable for the predictive model.

Data preprocessing is a critical step to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset. This process includes:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing any outliers that could skew the analysis.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to enhance the model's predictive power. For example, calculating ratios or differences between certain measurements.
Normalization and Scaling: Standardizing the data to ensure that features with different scales do not disproportionately influence the model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves a thorough examination of the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between dental features and gender. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots help in understanding the distribution of features and identifying any significant differences between genders. Statistical tests are also conducted to quantify these differences.

Model Development
The core of the project is the development of a machine learning model to predict gender based on dental features. Several algorithms are considered, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
XG Boost Classifier
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the models' performance. Cross-validation is employed to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Model Evaluation and Interpretation
The performance of the predictive models is assessed using accuracy metrics. Confusion matrices provide additional insights into the models' ability to distinguish between genders.

Conclusion and Future Work
The project aims to establish a robust methodology for predicting gender based on dental features, contributing to both academic research and practical applications in fields such as forensic science and archaeology. Future work may involve expanding the dataset to include a more diverse population, exploring additional dental features, and refining the model to improve its accuracy and generalizability.

By integrating dental anthropology with advanced data science techniques, this project paves the way for innovative approaches to understanding the complex interplay between biology and gender, ultimately enhancing our ability to make accurate and meaningful predictions from dental data.
